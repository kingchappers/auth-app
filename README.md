# Authentication Tester App

This is a small scale attempt to integrate authentication within a basic react application. This is a single-page application (so it doesn't reload the entire page as the user interacts with it) that will allow a user to login to it and display information when the user is authenticated. 

I'll try and deploy this to AWS Cloudfront which should be a very cheap deployment method. I'm yet to decide whether to write the IaC within this repo or have a separate IaC repo, but we'll find out.
